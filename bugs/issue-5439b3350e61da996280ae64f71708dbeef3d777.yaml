title: Add a barcode for ease of finding the correct record to the print template
desc: |-
  In the print template we'll need to be able to show a barcode for the
  Cassandra row ID of the just-created record.

  Ideally this would be shown as a small barcode so it can just be scanned, but
  with the text ID underneath. This should solve any problems with finding the
  right database record associated with the membership request.
  
  There shouldn't be any privacy concerns in this as we would only expose to an
  external attacker which row IDs we assigned, but they're 128-bit random
  GUIDs. It should be hard to guess them, and even if they're guessed they
  don't expose any information about the requestor.
