title: Implement proof of concept web service which displays and accepts the membership form
desc: |-
  As a first step, implement a proof of concept HTTP server which just displays
  the membership application form and lets people submit it, leading to the
  printable application.

  Add some amount of input validation here so what people submit actually makes
  sense.

    It displays the web sites just fine now.
    The input is also verified. Tested with some random input.
